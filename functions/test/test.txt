We won't make you implement any tests for this challenge, 
but we still want to see how you think about testing your code. 

If you WERE to implement tests for your function, what cases would you test?

List each case below in plain english with it's expected result. 

For example...

Case: user a views user b's recording x for the first time
Expected Result: etc etc

Case 1: User A views user B's recording X for the first time.
Expected Result: Increment the uniqueRecordingViewCount for 
user A by 1 and append the ID of recording X to the String Array, 
then increment the uniqueViewCount for recording X by 1.

Case 2: user A views user B's recording X for the second time
Expected Result: no actions.

Case 3: user A starts user B's recording X for the first time
on multiple devices at the same moment.
Expected Result: Increment the uniqueRecordingViewCount for 
user A by 1 and append the ID of recording X to the String Array, 
then increment the uniqueViewCount for recording X by 1.

Case 4: User C views user B's recording X for the first time.
Expected Result: Increment the uniqueRecordingViewCount for 
user C by 1 and append the ID of recording X to the String Array, 
then increment the uniqueViewCount for recording X by 1.

Case 5: X number of unique users views user's A recording Z for
the first time.
Expected Result: Increment the uniqueRecordingViewCount for 
all users by 1 and append the ID of recording Z to the String Array, 
then increment the uniqueViewCount for recording Z by X.

Case 6: User A views User B's recording A for the first time
Expected Result: recordingA viewCount is now 1

Case 7: User A views User B's recording A for the second time
Expected Result: recordingA viewCount is now 1

Case 8: User B views User A's recording B for the second time
Expected Result: recordingB viewCount is now 1

Case 9: User B views User A's recording NonExisting for the second time
Expected Result: error, recording doesn't exist

Case 10: User Q views User A's recording NonExisting for the second time
Expected Result: error, viewer doesn't exist

Case 11: User B views User B's recording A for the first time
Expected Result: recordingA viewCount remains at 1

Case 12: User B views User A's recording C for the first time
Expected Result: User A's total recording view count is incremented to 2
